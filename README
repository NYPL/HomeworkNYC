*************************************************
basic app/widgets directory structure

All app/widgets are in the 'widgets' directory
Each app/widget is in a directory of its own
_{filename}.php are files that are not called directly(there may be exceptions). No attempt is (yet) made to prevent them from being called directly 


__README				this file
_core.php				bunch of random php function that are shared across app/widgets
_db.php					minimal wrapper functions for connecting to and querying mysql 
_feedback_form.php		html form that posts to Google Docs :: https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0AkfCATB01ksMdHI3UFN4TDV2SDVBMG5FSXZkWnNkYmc&hl=en&output=html
_platform.php			houses the code that determines what platform this code is running on. This is far from perfect and always changing (so far)
_share_url.php			houses "addthis" code which is used in several places.
_widget.css				cross-app css
_widget.footer.php		cross-app footer (mostly station identification, cross-app nav, credits, feedback)
